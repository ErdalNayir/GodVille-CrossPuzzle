# GodVille-CrossPuzzle
I created word  search program to solve cross puzzle on GodVille game, easily.


### How it works ?

* First you need to choose what you want to search\n
* Second yo need to give letter group as a input to program 
* Program will return names which has specific letter group that you gave to the program
